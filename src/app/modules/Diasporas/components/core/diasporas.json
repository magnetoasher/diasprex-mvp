His professional journey in the last 15 years has taken multiple turns from academic research to industry and entrepreneurial endeavors. This dynamic experience provides deep appreciation for the connection between research, development, and product commercialization. His technical background cuts across analytical instrumentation, separation, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, proteomics, biopharmaceutical analytical developments, and data analysis. He has made modest contributions to the scientific community as an author of several research publications, conference presentations, and a reviewer for several peer-reviewed journals. Following four years of academic research, he spent seven years in the biopharmaceutical development environment serving in both technical and leadership roles for early and late-stage drug development, characterization, method transfer to QC and CROs, regulatory risk assessment and control strategies, and cross functional collaborations on process and workflow optimization. In these roles, he acquired good understanding of regulatory frameworks (FDA, EMA, GMP, and ICH guidelines) for analytical development in drug development. Currently, he is the founder and CEO of GMJ Technologies, Inc. developing novel life science tools for biopharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Through GMJ Technologies, Inc., Dr Dada has received multiple Small Business Innovation Research Award from the National Science Foundation, and contributed to the development of technologies for proteomics and biopharmaceutical protein analysis In addition to his scientific background, Dr Dada is an African development enthusiast. He is passionate about the African promising future and how African diasporas can contribute to developments on the continent through business collaboration with fellow citizens in Africa. He is the co-founder of Diasprex, Inc., a group developing a dynamic platform for mobilizing African diaspora’s resources for African development.",
